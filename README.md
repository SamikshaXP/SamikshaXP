🚀 About Me
 🔭 Currently working on personal web projects & learning full-stack development.  
 🌱 Expanding my skills in React, Node.js, and open source collaboration.  
 🎯 Driven by curiosity, a love for clean UI, and an eye for detail.  
 🎵 Fun fact: I blend code with a dash of music and a whole lot of chai. ☕  
 “Code is poetry – and I'm learning to write better verses every day.”
